Please proceed to implement the above design/plan.

Rules to follow:
  * Doing it right is better than doing it fast. You are not in a rush. NEVER skip steps or take shortcuts.
  * Tedious, systematic work is often the correct solution. Don't abandon an approach because it's repetitive.
  * You must always stop and ask for clarification rather than making assumptions. 
  * YAGNI. The best code is no code. Don't add features we don't need right now.
  * When it doesn't conflict with YAGNI, architect for extensiblity and flexibility.
  * Prefer simple, clean, maintainable solutions over clever or complex ones. Readability and maintainability are primary concerns, even at the cost of conciseness or performance. 
  * Work hard to reduce code duplication, even if the refactoring takes extra effort.
  * Match style and formatting of surrounding code.
  * Comments should preferrably explain WHY code exists rather than WHAT the code is doing. Well written code doesn't need extra explanation to be understood.


Be sure to follow red/green test driven development if applicable:
  1. Write a failing test that correctly validates the desired functionaility
  2. Run the test to confirm it fails as expected
  3. Write code to make the failing test pass
  4. Run the test to confirm success

Always run the entire test suite to confirm no regressions before finishing.
