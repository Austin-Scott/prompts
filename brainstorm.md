I've got an idea I want to talk through with you. I want you to turn it into a fully formed design and eventually an implementation. Check out the current state of the working directory to understand where we're starting off, then ask me questions, one at a time, to help refine the idea. Ideally, the questions would be multiple choice, but open-ended questions are OK, too. Don't forget: only one question per message. Once you believe you understand what we're doing well enough to not need to make ANY assumptions when implementing it, stop and desscibe the design to me, in sections of 200-300 words at a time, asking after each section whether it looks right so far. Do not proceed with implementation until I tell you to.
