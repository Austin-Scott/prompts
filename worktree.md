I want you to add a new git working tree to this repository. At the root there is a bare git repo with folders corresponding to the names of each branch that has a working tree (repo-root/main, repo-root/featureOne, etc.). We are likely inside of one of those branch folders now. 

Proceedure:

  1. Ensure any current uncommitted changes are stashed
  2. Run `git worktree add -b $1 ../$1`
  3. Apply (keeping the stashed changes on the stack for later use) stashed changes to the newly created folder (if there were any changes stashed in step 1)
  4. Copy any git ignored files that can't be autogenerated (such as with `npm install` for initializing `node_modules/`) to the new folder. This will include things like API keys and data files.
  5. Run any initilization commands necessary in the new folder (such as `npm install`)
  6. Pop stashed changes (if any were stashed in step 1) to keep the current working directory unchanged from before starting this proceedure.

Work quickly and don't overthink this. This is a simple proceedure.
